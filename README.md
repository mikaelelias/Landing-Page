The landing-page project was developed to apply my knowledge in html and css. In the html structure, the project begins with the header distributing the page navigation among the logo, menu, and search field, in this block I applied flexbox concepts.

In the next section, we have the brand presentation with an informative text and the use of a gif with the purpose of animating the project and making it more dynamic.

The next section features a background image highlighting the center of the page and creating a visual section of the store's products with the aim of impacting future users.

Continuing with the development, I implemented a block of images using flexbox in the html structure for better positioning of the elements, following a pattern of alignment and highlighting the main elements.
